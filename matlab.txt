if i want to find and average of an array in matlab 
temp=[10 12 13 13 13 14 15 25 23]
avgTemp= mean(temp)

if i want to plot graph then i use 
plot (temp)
it will show graph

A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors −

Row vectors
Column vectors
Row Vectors
Row vectors are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.

r = [7 8 9 10 11]
MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result −

r =

   7    8    9   10   11 

Column vectors are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit the elements.

c = [7;  8;  9;  10; 11]
MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result −

c =
      7       
      8       
      9       
      10       
      11  
A = [7, 11, 15, 23, 9];
B = [2, 5, 13, 16, 20];
C = A + B;
D = A - B;
disp(C);
disp(D);
When you run the file, it displays the following result −

9    16    28    39    29
5     6     2     7   -11


Array Creation
To create an array with four elements in a single row, separate the elements with either a comma (,) or a space.

a = [1 2 3 4]
a = 1×4

     1     2     3     4

This type of array is a row vector.

To create a matrix that has multiple rows, separate the rows with semicolons.

a = [1 3 5; 2 4 6; 7 8 10]
a = 3×3

     1     3     5
     2     4     6
     7     8    10
